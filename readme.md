# Lily Material Library

## Dev Setup

- Create a `local.properties` in the root project and add the `sdk.dir` property so that the androidMain module can compile.
- Ensure the Android plugin is installed if you plan to use IDEA. 

## About

This library is meant to be a collection of things related to Jetpack Compose that I use across various projects and platforms.

## Contributing

I'm unlikely to accept contributions. While this is open source, and you're welcome to fork or use it, this is built for me first and foremost.

You are welcome to submit PRs or Issues, however, I make no guarantees about acceptance nor about providing resolutions.
